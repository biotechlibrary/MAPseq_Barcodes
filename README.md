# MAPseq_Barcodes
Processing and analysis of barcode data obtained from MAPseq experiments. This pipeline is designed to enable users to download, generate, or use existing fastq sequences for extracting and pre-processing barcode sequences. The pipeline analyzes these apparent barcodes and returns a list of true underlying barcodes.
